## Welcome to Kleber's Website!

I'm Kleber Hugo Stangherlin, a PhD student on the ECE department at University of Waterloo. You will be able to find here information about things I've been working on, recent publications, and maybe one or two humble opinions on random matters.

Hope you find something interesthing!

PS. As you may see, still under development. :)
